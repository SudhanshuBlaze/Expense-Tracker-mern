# Expense Tracker in Reactjs

The following web app uses the create-a-react boilerplate to base its code

From there it is split up into serveral sections

- public
  - index.html - Gives the react app a place to render
  - favicon.ico - icon on the tab bar

<br/>

- src | Heart of the ReactJS app
  - components - folder filled with reactjs components
  - context - Globalstate folder, used alongside hooks
  - index.css - css file for index.js
  - index.js - loads all our compoments and lays them out

### What I learned

- React Context API
- useReducerhook.
- implemented a REST API to maintain CRUD operations on mongoDB
- Used axios to perform HTTP requests from client to backend server. Setup the MERN app for production.

### Further Plans

- Implement a login system
- Dark mode?
- Catergories of different payment types
